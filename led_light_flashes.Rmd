## When I turn my AMOD on and try to pair it, the LED light flashes.

Your device likely had a complete battery drain. Please charge the AMOD and then proceed to connect to the device. The LED light will stop flashing once it has reestablished GPS clock time.

**Tip:** Turn on the unit while it is outside to help reestablish GPS clock time.
