## The AMOD will not connect to my Wi-Fi.

If you are outside, go indoors and try to connect while inside. Then go back outside and check if your Wi-Fi signal is strong enough to connect to your phone.

If not, you may need to move the AMOD closer to the Wi-Fi router or powercycle both the CEAMS app and the AMOD.

If this does not fix the issue, you may have to let the AMOD run with Wi-Fi turned off. In this case, you will not be able to see your data on the website in real-time.

After the sample period is done, you can take the device back inside to charge and connect to Wi-Fi. The device will push some of the missed data to the website.

If the AMOD will still not connect to Wi-Fi, please contact the Emory team for support.
