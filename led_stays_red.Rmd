## The LED light stays solid orange when I push 'Start Sampling'/ is unable to find the sun.

This is likely because the AMOD GPS has not synced. Therefore, it does not know its location and cannot calculate the angle for the sun.

Occasionally, it will have to wait until the second scan (20 minutes after the start time) to locate itself and find the sun.
