## The AMOD does not show up when I push 'Scan' in the CEAMS mobile application.

First, check that you have Bluetooth enabled on your phone (ensure your phone can connect to any Bluetooth device).

Second, make sure that the AMOD is turned on and that the LED light is pink.

If the device still does not appear, try restarting your phone or using another mobile device with the CEAMS application.

**Tip:** Connect the unit to a computer to see if the device is discoverable on the computer. This will identify whether the device is functional.
