## My device will not turn on.

**Step 1:** Make sure the unit is connected to a working power supply, whether this be a wall outlet or a battery.

**Step 2:** Check the functionality of the LED light. Does the LED light come on when it is charging (plugged in)? It should be a light magenta color.

If not, try pressing down on the button for at least 3 seconds and listen for whether you hear the device turn on. If it does, then only the LED light is out, and you can still pair the device.

**Step 3:** If nothing happens when pressing the button, try leaving the device charging overnight. Again, check if the LED light is on while it is charging.

If the LED light is not coming on after charging overnight, please contact the Emory team.
